# dev-love-sobie

This project is a redesigned and modernized “About” section for the <b>Society of Business</b>, <b>Industry</b>, and <b>Economics</b> (SOBIE) website. The goal was to create a clean, informative layout that highlights SOBIE’s history, mission, and journal, JOBIE.

The site features a card-based layout styled with custom CSS, incorporating SOBIE’s brand colors navy and gold for visual consistency. Section dividers, hover effects, and structured content help guide the user experience.

This page was designed with clarity, accessibility, and professional presentation in mind. It is ideal for both prospective conference attendees and academic visitors. 👏
